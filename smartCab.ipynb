    "# Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project you will apply reinforcement learning techniques for a self-driving agent in a simplified world to aid it in effectively reaching its destinations in the allotted time. You will first investigate the environment the agent operates in by constructing a very basic driving implementation. Once your agent is successful at operating within the environment, you will then identify each possible state the agent can be in when considering such things as traffic lights and oncoming traffic at each intersection. With states identified, you will then implement a Q-Learning algorithm for the self-driving agent to guide the agent towards its destination within the allotted time. Finally, you will improve upon the Q-Learning algorithm to find the best configuration of learning and exploration factors to ensure the self-driving agent is reaching its destinations with consistently positive results."

    "## Description\n",
    "In the not-so-distant future, taxicab companies across the United States no longer employ human drivers to operate their fleet of vehicles. Instead, the taxicabs are operated by self-driving agents — known as **smartcabs** — to transport people from one location to another within the cities those companies operate. In major metropolitan areas, such as Chicago, New York City, and San Francisco, an increasing number of people have come to rely on **smartcabs** to get to where they need to go as safely and efficiently as possible. Although **smartcabs** have become the transport of choice, concerns have arose that a self-driving agent might not be as safe or efficient as human drivers, particularly when considering city traffic lights and other vehicles. To alleviate these concerns, your task as an employee for a national taxicab company is to use reinforcement learning techniques to construct a demonstration of a smartcab operating in real-time to prove that both safety and efficiency can be achieved."

    "To begin, your only task is to get the smartcab to move around in the environment. At this point, you will not be concerned with any sort of optimal driving policy. Note that the driving agent is given the following information at each intersection:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The next waypoint location relative to its current location and heading.\n",
    "- The state of the traffic light at the intersection and the presence of oncoming vehicles from other directions.\n",
    "- The current time left from the allotted deadline.\n",
    "To complete this task, simply have your driving agent choose a random action from the set of possible actions (`None`, `'forward'`, `'left'`, `'right'`) at each intersection, disregarding the input information above. Set the simulation deadline enforcement, `enforce_deadline` to `False` and observe how it performs.\n",

    "### QUESTION: \n",
    "Observe what you see with the agent's behavior as it takes random actions. Does the **smartcab** eventually make it to the destination? Are there any other interesting observations to note?\n"
